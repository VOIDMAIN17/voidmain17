🎮 A passionate developer who loves coding and creating game tools for both Android and PC.  
🚀 I specialize in building **AI-based** and **memory-based** cheats, using powerful models like **YOLO**.  
💻 Whether it's **C#/.NET**, **JavaScript**, or **React Native**, I enjoy experimenting and pushing the limits of what’s possible.
